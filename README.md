# maze_Qlearning

When I was studying in Ritsumeikan University. My friend asked me for some help.
This is about an Route Plan Demo by using QLearning and DFS.

I think this is a good chance to make a summary about route planning algorithms.

Now, there have been QLearning, DFS and generation algorithon (in other repository).
By the way, my graduation work is based on multi-objective GA.
